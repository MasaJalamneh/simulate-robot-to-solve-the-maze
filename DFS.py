# Depth First Search DFS algorithm for solving mazes, the maze is a set of paths that the robot can explore. 
# Start at the robotâ€™s position, pick one direction and move as far along that path as possible.
# If a dead end or a visited place is reached, go back to the last place where other paths to try occur.
# Repeat this process until the goal is reached.
